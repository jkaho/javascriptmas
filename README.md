# JavaScriptmas Challenge 2020 

## Description 

This application is a collection of interactive solutions to the scrimba.com 2020 JavaScriptmas challenge. 

## Motivations

Over the Christmas break, I wanted to practise the front-end web development skills I had recently learned (namely, HTML, CSS & JavaScript), so I took on the JavaScript challenge offered by scrimba.com and made it into an interactive website.
