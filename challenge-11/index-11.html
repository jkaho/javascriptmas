        <h1>Avoid Obstacles</h1>        
        <p>
            Each number in your array represents the coordinates of an obstacle on a straight line.
            <br><br>
            Find the smallest number that can 'jump' through your array without hitting an obstacle.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Example: </strong> The result of the array [5, 3, 6, 7, 9] would be 4.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Explanation: </strong>
                <br>
                A jump of 1 creates the jump sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., meaning it will hit all obstacles.
                <br>
                A jump of 2 creates the sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc, meaning it hits the obstacle at coordinate 6.
                <br>
                A jump of 3 creates the sequence: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc, meaning it hits the obtacles at coordintes 3, 6, and 9.
                <br>
                A jump of 4 creates the sequence: 4, 8, 12, 16, 18, etc, meaning it does not hit any of the obstacles.
