        <h1>Array Previous Less</h1> 
        <p>
            Create a new array of integers from your initial array of integers.
            <br><br>
            Each integer, <em>i</em>, in your array will be compared with the integers that come before it.
            The last number (from the left) that is smaller than integer <em>i</em> will take integer <em>i's</em> position in a new array.
            If there are no smaller integers to the left of integer <em>i</em>, -1 will take its place in the new array.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Example: </strong>The array [3, 5, 2, 4, 5] will return [-1, 3, -1, 2, 4].
            <br>
            <strong>Explanation: </strong>
            <br>
            - 3 has nothing to the left of it, so -1 takes its place in the returned array.
            <br>
            - 5 is larger than 3, so the second integer in the new array is 3. 
            <br>
            - There are no integers to the left of 2 that are smaller than it, so -1 takes its place in the new array.
            <br>
            - 3 and 2 are both smaller than 4, however, 2 is the last from the left, so 2 is the fourth integer in the new array.
            <br>
            - 3, 2 and 4 are all smaller than 5, however, 4 is the last from the left, so 4 is the last integer in the new array.
