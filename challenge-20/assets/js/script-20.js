// -------Challenge------- // 
// GoDaddy makes a lot of different top-level domains available to its customers
// A top-level domain is one that goes directly after the last dot ('.') in the domain name
// Example: .com in example.com
/* To help users choose from available domains, GoDaddy is introducing a new feature 
    that shows the type of the chosen top-level domain
*/
// You have to implement this feature
/* To begin with, you want to write a function that labels the domains as "commercial",
    "organization", "network" or "information" for .com, .org, .net or .info, respectively
*/
// For the given list of domains, return the list of their labels
